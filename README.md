# Introduction
The revocation work item group is part of the crypto-wg (https://identity.foundation/working-groups/crypto.html). 
We will define one or more revocation methods for verifiable credentials.
The base of this working group is the definition of the work item. You can find the description here https://github.com/decentralized-identity/crypto-wg/blob/main/work_items/revocation_methods_for_verifiable_credentials_.md

# Meetings
Regular meetings will be held bi-weekly on Thursday. Just before the crypto-wg call.
Starting Thursday 20:00 CEST 16.09.2021
Details see DIF calender.

## Procedure and Status
We do not start with a specific accumulator method. We will first collect all possible methods, group them, assess them and then select suitable methods. 
With this method we want to avoid iterations and ensure that we have assessed all promissing methods.

| Step #| Step                                | Status      | Owner   |
|----   |---------                            |-------------|---------|
|1      |Collect revocation methods |Running|tbd|
|2      |Define assessment setup (#of entries, #of revocations per epoch,...)<br />for performance testing |To-Do|tbd|
|3      |- Define requirements for privacy (correlation (linked, linkable), traceability,<br />leaking of usage data,..)<br />- Define performance requirements (computational effort, storage,<br />data transmission, sizes,...)|To-Do |tbd|
|4      |Assess the revocation methods and define one or more revocation methods<br />that fits the purpose|To-Do|tbd|
|5      |Create the protocol|To-Do|tbd|
